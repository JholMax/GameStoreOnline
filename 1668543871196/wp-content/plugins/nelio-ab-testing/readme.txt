== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use an A/B Testing Solution specifically designed for WordPress? =

* **Smooth learning curve.** There is no need to learn yet another tool.
Everything (from the creation of tests to the visualization of the results) is done from the WordPress dashboard you are familiar with, resulting in a well-known, perfectly integrated user interface.
* **Evolve your WordPress site easily.** A native WordPress solution automates and simplifies the evolution of your site. Consider, for example, applying the winner alternative in your site as soon as the results are statistically significant. With a native solution, this is as easy as clicking one single button. With a generic tool, on the other hand, you would have to manually modify the page so that it integrates the changes you created in the (winning) alternative.
* **Fine-grained testing.** The ‚Äútesting unit‚Äù in a generic tool is the web page, since the HTML of the page is the only thing those tools have access to. A native WordPress solution, however, permits you to test any WordPress specific component, such as posts, pages, CSS, themes, child themes, and many more coming!
